- cd into it and run _npm install_

- start the server with _npm run dev_
- open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser

After signing up for an accout, you can use Prisma Studio to make the user administrator (set _isAdmin_ to true). Once you have a user that is administrator, you can access the admin console at
_/admin_.
